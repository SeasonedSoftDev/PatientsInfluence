<h2>What makes Patients Influence different?</h2>
<p>
  Firstly, at Patients Influence, we prioritize transparency and fairness. We don't sneak in any hidden fees or commissions - what you earn is wholly yours. No surprises!
</p>
<p>
  Secondly, we've engineered a distinctive algorithm, a win-win-win creation for everyone. It not only increases your earnings but also gives healthcare companies a higher return on their investments. This tool allows you to set a higher income, while we can generate revenue by identifying the perfect matches for campaigns or surveys. And that's the secret sauce - our algorithm doesn't just benefit us as a company, it also enhances the value you provide, leading to higher pay and long-lasting relationships with healthcare firms.
</p>
<p>
  Lastly, Patients Influence is deeply grounded in a personal journey of resilience and determination. Our founder, Ivan, a Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma survivor, defied all odds to excel in academics, sports, and his professional journey at Roche. Although he became the youngest Key Opinion Leader in his field, Ivan saw an opportunity to give back and bring about change. Thus, Patients Influence was born. While he laid the platform's foundation, he sees it as a shared space belonging to you, the patients. His experiences, his fight, his small victories – they're all woven into the very fabric of Patients Influence, a platform born from empathy, understanding, and a drive to create meaningful change. This is Ivan's way of leveraging his experiences for the greater good. That, in essence, encapsulates the Patients Influence difference!
